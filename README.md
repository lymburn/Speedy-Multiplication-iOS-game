Speedy Multiplication is my 2nd iOS game made from Cocos2d-x game engine. After finishing Color Chase, I still had some extra time left in my summer break and wanted to make another game. However, I was rather occupied with family vacations, looking for housing, and spending time with friends. Therefore, I had to scope out a simple project that I could finish within 1-2 weeks.

Speedy Multiplication is inspired by the countless math games on the web that I used to play as a child. Although it was easier to make than my previous game, it was just as fun to program. I have always wanted a way to tie together education and video games and this game is one step in that direction. 

The game itself uses roughly the same programming concepts as Color Chase and does not add many new techniques. It was made in roughly a week (with vacation gaps in between) as a way of further solidifying my C++ experience, as well as putting my own educational game on the market.
